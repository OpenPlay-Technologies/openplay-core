- Make the balance manager shared like in deepbook, where you have an owner and PlayCaps (instead of TradeCaps)
- Support other currencies to play with instead of just SUI
- Make a PLAY governance token such that stakers of this token receive the protocol fee, and they can vote on proposals to change fee structures
- AUDIT!! integer overflow, random vulnerabilities (gas cost per flow), and other possible vulnerabilities
- Make it so that the game can also be activated on a new stake transactions, and not just on epoch change
- pending stake should only become activated stake if the game managed to start
- Referral system where anyone can launch a game for a user to get commission on it
- make unstaking / staking directly work with the main wallet, without the need for a balance manager
- add metadata like an NFT to the games
